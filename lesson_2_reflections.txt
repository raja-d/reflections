Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An hidden folder .git is created and the directory is now treated as a git repository. 
	Because this folder stores all the commit history and stuff.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is the middle stage which tracks which files will be addes to repository after commit. 
	After commit it changes to repository. Working directory is normal directory without history.
